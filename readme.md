## **Breakout Game**

A simple Python game, utilising the Turtle module, based on the popular 'Breakout' classic videogame.

Developer's notes:

29/03/2021 - Collision detection is not as good as I would like and would be something to work on. I think this is around the bounce code and the ball not being far enough away so appears to get stuck bouncing around the paddle / bricks.
